# Web-Came-Motion-Detector
The Web Cam Motion Detector is a project developed in Python with the help of 'cv2' library. This program turns on the Web Camera of the user's machine and detects the moving objects. It makes a green rectangle around the object if the program finds it moving. It also saves the initial state and then compares it with the further changes.
